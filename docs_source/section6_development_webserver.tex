\section{Starting up the development web server}
    Now that everything is set, you can start Django's development web server 
    by running the following command:
    \code{python manage.py runserver}.\\
    
    And then, if you open your web browser at \url{http://127.0.0.1:8000/}, 
    you should see something like this:

    \end{figure}
  
    \newpage
    
    You can also provide a host and a port, by doing like so for example:\\
    \code{python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:5000}. \\
    
    \emph{Note: to stop the server, hit \texttt{Ctrl-C} in the terminal.}
