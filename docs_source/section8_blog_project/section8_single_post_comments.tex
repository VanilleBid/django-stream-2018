\subsection{Viewing comments over a single blog post}
    For the \emph{section~\ref{sec:the-forms}} demo example, 
    we woud like to prepare a little 'comments' feature into our blog.
    We are gonna add a new \code{Comment} model and clicking on the posts title
    will now redirect the user to the single view by updating the template, URLs and views.
