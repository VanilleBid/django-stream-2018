\subsubsection{Creating the migrations and tables}
    Now that we have the models, we need to create the django migrations 
    and then SQL tables through the migrations.
    
    To generate the models migrations, run \code{python manage.py makemigrations blog}.
    This should output the following:
            
    \begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
Migrations for 'blog':
  blog/migrations/0001_initial.py:
  - Create model Post
    \end{lstlisting}
        
    Then, we can run \\ \code{python manage.py migrate blog} to create the database tables,
    and we should get the following output:
            
    \begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: blog
Running migrations:
  Applying blog.0001_initial... OK
    \end{lstlisting}
