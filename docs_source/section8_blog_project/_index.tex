\section{A demo project: a simple blog}
    To show how Django works, the best way is to look and learn from an example project code.
    So, here it is: let's build a simple blog. This blog will allow you to create and edit blog posts,
    and to post comments.
    
    Run \code{python manage.py startapp blog}, to create our base blog application.
    Then, in your site settings (\code{mysite/settings.py}), add the \code{blog}
    application to the installed apps, 
    by finding the \code{INSTALLED\textunderscore APPS} variable 
    and appending \code{blog} to it. Like so:
    
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=python, numbers=none, title=\texttt{mysite/settings.py}]
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'blog'  # our blog application added here
]
    \end{lstlisting}
